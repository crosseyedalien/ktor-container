The purpose of this project is to provide a basic Ktor container image. No frills, doesn't connect to anything else,
just a starting point for Ktor.

This project uses:
OpenJDK 11
Gradle 6.5.1
Kotlin ???
Ktor ???
Netty ???

Quickstart:
1) Build the source. In the project root, run the following command:
$ gradle build

2) Build the docker image.
$ docker build -t <repo:tag> .

3) Run container.
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name <ctr-name> <repo:tag>

4) Check that the application is running at http://localhost:8080


ROADMAP:
1) Ktor documentation kind of sucks. All of the examples I have come across seem to use out-of-date software. So
one of the first things I want to do is bring that up-to-date. Trying to build a Ktor application with IntelliJ IDEA
results in errors when I try to follow their online directions.
- most recent versions of:
--- OpenJDK
--- Gradle
--- Kotlin
--- Ktor
--- Netty (or equivalent)
2) There seems to be confusion surrounding Ktor and Java 9 (jdk9+). Not sure what the answer is. The latest Gradle
will build this application, but the version of Netty throws a lot of exceptions. Some forums are saying this is a
problem with Ktor's compatibility with Java 9.
