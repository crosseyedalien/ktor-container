The purpose of this project is to provide a basic Ktor container image. No frills, doesn't connect to anything else,
just a starting point for Ktor. There is a basic 'Hello' application in the src directory.

This project uses:
OpenJDK 11
Gradle 6.5.1
Kotlin 1.3.72
Ktor 1.3.2
Alpine Linux:latest

Quickstart:
1) Build the source. In the project root, run the following command:
$ gradle build

2) Build the docker image.
$ docker build -t <repo:tag> .

3) Run container.
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name <ctr-name> <repo:tag>

4) Check that the application is running at http://localhost:8080

5) (optional) You can change the name of the Kotlin jar file to execute by using --build-arg
$ docker build -t <repo:tag> --build-arg JAR_ARG=<jar-file> .

NOTES:

1) OpenJDK may need to be rolled back to version 8 as netty runs with exceptions. Or maybe there is an alternative...
2) OpenJDK11 is the most recent JDK offered by Alpine

UP NEXT...:

1) Understand what is up with Netty exceptions and what all the options are.
2) IntelliJ IDEA does not successfully build with the gradle file.
3) I'd like to commit the container image to a repository and then use it for future Ktor projects. So need
    to see if there are any other little details to take care of.
